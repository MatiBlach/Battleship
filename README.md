# Battleship
Given a 10 x 10 board game of ships, partially filled with ships. The board is represented by a two-dimensional array of characters. Empty squares are marked with ’.’ and ships with ’*’. There is at least 1 space between ships. Change the layout of the board so that ships are represented by numbers instead of stars. The numbers correspond to the size of the ship (modulo 10 - so a ship of size 10 is 0).
